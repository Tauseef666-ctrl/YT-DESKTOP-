# NewPipe+ — Feature Inventory & Preservation Contract

Base: fresh clone of `TeamNewPipe/NewPipe`, branch `dev`, commit `4b6264de6f`.
This document is the **source of truth for behaviour**. No feature listed here may be
removed, disabled, or silently replaced. When a feature moves, its behaviour moves with it.

> Status: Phase-1 deliverable. Every row is grounded in the Phase-1 audit (file paths verified in-tree).

## 1. Starting condition (module map)

| Module | Language / stack | What it actually is |
|---|---|---|
| `:app` | Java/Kotlin + XML Views, ExoPlayer 2.19.1, Room, giga download engine, RxJava3 | **The complete NewPipe app.** Android-only. |
| `shared` | Kotlin Multiplatform + Compose Multiplatform (android / jvm / ios) | **New Compose UI skeleton.** Currently About + Settings only. |
| `:desktopApp` | Compose Desktop (JVM) | 18-line `Main.kt` hosting `shared`'s `App()`; starts on About. |
| `iosApp` | SwiftUI host | Xcode shell only. |

Design system lives in `shared/src/commonMain/.../theme`; UI strings/drawables in
`shared/src/commonMain/composeResources`. Version = `buildSrc/ProjectConfig.kt` (`0.29.1`).

**Consequence:** all real features live in `:app`. NewPipe+ desktop functionality
(the whole point) is a **port** of `:app` behaviour onto `shared`/`jvmMain`/`:desktopApp`,
reusing `:app` as the behavioural reference — plus the 10 enhancements.

## 2. Feature inventory

Legend — **Where**: current implementation location. **State**: `full` / `partial` / `none` **on desktop**.

### 2.1 Navigation & shell
| Feature | Where (current) | Desktop state | Preservation / verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| Launcher + drawer (Subscriptions, Feed, Bookmarks, Downloads, History, Settings, Donation, About) | `app/.../MainActivity.java:123-130,241` | none | Recreate all destinations; verify each opens a real screen. |

### 2.5 Subscriptions / discovery
| Feature | Where (current) | Desktop state | Preservation / verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| Subscriptions | `local/subscription/SubscriptionFragment.kt` + DAOs | none | Keep; verify data. |
| Channel groups | `database/feed/*`, `FeedGroup*Dialog` | none | Keep. |
| Feed (from groups) | `local/feed/FeedFragment.kt` | none | Keep. |

### 2.6 Settings (all preserved)
- 13 preference XMLs: `app/src/main/res/xml/*` (main, video_audio, appearance, download,
  history, content, notifications ×2, player_notification, update, exoplayer,
  backup_restore, debug).
- **234 keys** in `app/src/main/res/values/settings_keys.xml` (appearance, playback, open
  actions, content/language, history/search, feed, notifications, downloads/storage,
  import/export, tabs, ExoPlayer, misc).
- Shared-module equivalents already exist for Appearance (`AppearancePreferences`) and
  Video/Audio + ExoPlayer (`VideoAudioPreferences`, `ExoPlayerPreferences`).
- **Rule:** preserve every key + semantics; add desktop equivalents with the same meaning;
  no schema reset.

### 2.7 Backup & Restore
| Item | Where | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Export | `settings/export/ImportExportManager.kt` | ZIP = `newpipe.db` + `newpipe.settings` (legacy serialized prefs) |
| Filenames | `settings/export/BackupFileLocator.kt` | `newpipe.db`, `newpipe.settings`, `preferences.json` |
| UI | `settings/BackupRestoreSettingsFragment.java` (`ZIP_MIME_TYPE`) | import/export flow |
| Safe IO | `util/ZipHelper.java` (SAF-aware) | zip load with validation |
- **Preserve format.** Feature 4 adds desktop UI + optional encryption; must not break the
  existing ZIP compatibility.

### 2.8 Services / providers
- 5 services via NewPipeExtractor + `ServiceList`/`ServiceHelper`: YouTube (incl. Kids/Music),
  SoundCloud, media.ccc.de, PeerTube (instance config), Bandcamp.
- Keep the extractor integration; Feature 10 hardens the provider boundary without replacing it.

### 2.9 Tests & build/release
- Android unit: 22 files (`app/src/test`); instrumented: 9 (`app/src/androidTest`).
- Shared commonTest: 12 files; desktopApp: 0.
- CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`assembleContinuous lintContinuous testDebugUnitTest`,
  emulator `connectedCheck` ×2 APIs), `build-release-apk.yml` (unsigned release APK on `master`).
  **Desktop is never built in CI.**
- Versioning: `buildSrc/ProjectConfig.kt`; tags `vX.Y.Z`; fastlane changelogs by versionCode.

## 3. Preservation checklist (checked only with evidence)

- [ ] All navigation destinations exist and open real screens.
- [ ] Video/audio playback works via a real engine (desktop).
- [ ] Every existing player control present and functional (or marked unavailable with reason).
- [ ] Quality / speed / subtitles / audio-track selection work and persist.
- [ ] Repeat / autoplay / queue / next-prev / shuffle work.
- [ ] Every existing setting present, persists, and affects behaviour.
- [ ] Downloads: queue + states + pause/resume/cancel/retry + open file/folder + delete.
- [ ] Destination + storage preferences preserved.
- [ ] Local library (playlists/bookmarks/history) data preserved; new file-scan added.
- [ ] Subscriptions / groups / feed / import-export preserved.
- [ ] Search / trending / channels / playlists / comments preserved.
- [ ] Backup create/inspect/restore preserved (ZIP format intact).
- [ ] Provider integrations preserved; isolated failures.
- [ ] No user data reset; backward-compatible migrations only.
- [ ] Existing release packaging conventions preserved; new desktop artifacts added.

## 4. Desktop gap analysis (what is net-new)

Everything in `:app` must be ported to `shared`/`jvmMain`/`:desktopApp` **except** the
parts already present in `shared` (About, Settings Home/Appearance/Video-Audio/Player).
Net-new subsystems: JVM player engine (VLCJ), JVM download engine, JVM persistence for
DB-backed data (subscriptions/playlists/history), local file-library scan, desktop
navigation shell, desktop packaging (EXE/MSI), AND the 10 enhancements.

This gap is why the effort is staged and why `:app` stays untouched-but-buildable as the reference.
